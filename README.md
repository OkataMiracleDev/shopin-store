Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Interacting with the Application

1.  **Browse Products**: Navigate to the "Shop" page to explore all available products. You can filter by category using the buttons or search for specific items using the search bar.
2.  **View Product Details**: Click on any product card to see its dedicated detail page, including images, price, and description.
3.  **Add to Cart**: On a product's detail page or from an item card, use the "Add to Cart" button to add items to your shopping cart. You can specify the quantity before adding.
4.  **Manage Cart**: Access your cart via the "Cart" icon in the navigation bar. Here, you can adjust item quantities, remove items, or clear your entire cart.
5.  **Checkout**: Proceed to checkout from the cart page. Fill in the simulated payment details (name, email, address) and click "Pay Now" to complete the order. This is a frontend-only simulation; no actual payment is processed.
6.  **Thank You**: Upon successful "payment" (simulation), you will be redirected to a thank you page.
